childtalk
==========

Simple Smalltalk dialect written on Java for self-education reasons.
Project is frosen now.

Childtalk was my first complete interpreter. I try to write it in clear and good style, but
,as always, bugs and fixes do their job well.

Childtalk is based on <a href = 'http://code.google.com/p/syx/'>Smalltalk YX</a>
